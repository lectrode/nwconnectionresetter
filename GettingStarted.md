# A Guide to Using Lectrode's Network Connection Resetter #


## What is the purpose of this program? ##

Every once in a while (especially when connecting to the internet through a wireless router), your network connection may switch from "Internet Access" to "Limited Connectivity" or disconnect completely. This program tries to re-connect you to the internet using [common methods](FIXES.md).

This program can also be set to [monitor your internet connection](SETTING#CONTINUOUS.md) and automatically try to re-connect you if it detects you have been disconnected.


## Running the Program ##
If the program is not set to monitor your connection, the program will display 2 options: Run Program or Edit Configuration.

Run program will continue to run the program with the current settings.

Edit Configuration will take you to a new set of options allowing you to configure the different settings.
